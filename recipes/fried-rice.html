    <h3>Fried rice is a quick and delicious way to transform leftovers into something greater than the sum of its parts.</h3>
    <p>Fried rice has been a kitchen staple since as early as the Sui Dynasty (589&#8211;618 CE) in China. The primary reason for the continued popularity and ubiquity of this dish comes down to two things: its adaptability and the fact that people almost always cook too much rice to eat in one sitting.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp sesame oil, divided</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
        <li>3 green onions, thinly sliced, white and green parts divided</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp peeled and minced ginger (from a 1" piece)</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked long grain rice (preferably leftover)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>3 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 2 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil.</li>
        <li>Beat egg with 2 teaspoons water and a large pinch salt and add to skillet. Cook, stirring to form large soft curds, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Return skillet to high heat and add 2 tablespoons oil, the carrots, and whites of the green onions. Cook until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add rice, peas, and cooked eggs to skillet. Pour in soy sauce and cook, stirring until heated through, 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the remaining green onions.</li>
